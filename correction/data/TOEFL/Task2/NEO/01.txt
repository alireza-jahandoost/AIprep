Question :Doctor Caceres:
Let's explore a topic related to personal well-being. Many people believe that practicing yoga and meditation can have a positive impact on mental health and overall happiness. On the other hand, some argue that engaging in physical activities, such as exercise or sports, is equally beneficial for one's well-being. What is your perspective on this matter?
Mandy:
I strongly believe that practicing meditation can have a significant positive impact on personal well-being. These practices provide a space for relaxation. Before an important exam, I always do some yoga, and it significantly enhances my focus on studying.
Sam:
I personally prefer physical activities. Exercise elevates mood and reduces stress levels. My friends and I play volleyball twice a week. Because of that, I have gained some muscles and can easily sleep at night. Honestly, physical exercise is the best approach to staying healthy.
