Question :Doctor Gomez:
This time, let's explore the importance of financial literacy in children. Some argue that children should learn to manage their own money from a young age, while others believe it's better to delay this responsibility until they are older. In your opinion, do you think that to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age? Why or why not?
Michael:
I think children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. By controlling their finances early on, they develop important skills like budgeting and saving. This early exposure to financial responsibility sets a strong foundation for their future as financially independent adults.
Chloe:
I see your point Michael, but I don't believe that children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. They need to focus on their education and personal growth without the added stress of financial responsibilities. They can learn about money management later in life when they better understand real-life scenarios.
