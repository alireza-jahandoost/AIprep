Question :Doctor Harvey:
This week, let's propose a controversial debate to the class regarding consumerism. Some argue that consumerism brings numerous benefits to individuals and the economy. They believe it provides a wide range of choices and convenience for consumers. On the other hand, others contend that consumerism has its drawbacks and negative impacts. They argue that it promotes a culture of overconsumption and waste. What are your thoughts on this?
Sam:
Consumerism offers far more benefits, such as stimulating growth in the economy. For example, when people purchase new smartphones, they encourage the tech industry, increasing production and employment.
Elizabeth:
I am afraid I think otherwise, Sam. I believe that consumerism values possessions over personal well-being. For instance, the constant pursuit of the latest fashion trends can lead to a culture of dissatisfaction, where individuals constantly feel the need to acquire more and waste more.
