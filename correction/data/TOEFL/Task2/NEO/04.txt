Samuel:
We should certainly give preference to exploring our country first. Each country offers many sights and attractions that align well with our culture and background. This way, we can appreciate the beauty within our country more.
Mina:
Traveling overseas offers a unique experience. The diversity of cultures, food, and languages is just remarkable. You cannot find such an experience when you travel in your country. My trip to Japan, for instance, has provided me with many unmatched memories that I have cherished to this day.
