Question :Doctor Clemente:
Today, we will discuss a debated issue among travelers. When visiting a new destination, it's essential to have good information to make the most of the experience. Some people believe that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide. On the other hand, others argue that traveling solo or with a companion offers a unique experience, as individuals can gather information on their own without relying on a tour guide. What do you think about this?
Stephen:
I believe that traveling in a group with a tour guide is the best way to travel. It provides a sense of security and convenience, as the tour guide can handle logistics and provide valuable insights about the destination. Not to mention, I have made many friends during these group trips.
Claire:
I am afraid I have to disagree with Stephen that traveling with a tour guide is the best way to travel. Traveling solo or with a companion allows for more freedom and flexibility in exploring a new destination. In this manner, I can create my own schedules, which is impossible in a guided group setting.
