Question :Doctor Primer:
Today, we will explore an exciting topic among book enthusiasts regarding electronic versus traditional books. Some argue that traditional books offer a unique reading experience that electronic books cannot replicate. On the other hand, others say that electronic books offer convenience and interactive features that enhance the reading experience. What are your thoughts on this ongoing debate? Do you think electronic books provide us with more benefits than traditional books?
Ted:
Electronic books are definitely superior to traditional ones. They are portable and convenient, allowing readers to carry an entire library in their pocket. For example, I have downloaded all of this semester's books on my phone and can read them everywhere.
Hasan:
I disagree with Ted. While electronic books have their merits, traditional books are essentially harmless for your eyes. Nowadays, many children are forced to wear glasses due to looking at their smartphones for too long. What will happen to my eyes if I want to read countless pages for an exam?
