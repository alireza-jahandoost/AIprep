Question :Doctor Smith:
Today, we will explore a topic that has long been debated in the realm of leadership. Some argue that leadership is a natural trait, something that individuals are born with. They believe certain innate qualities such as charisma, confidence, and decisiveness make someone a natural leader. On the other hand, others contend that leadership is a skill that can be developed through learning, experience, and practice. What are your thoughts on this?
Pedro:
Leadership is definitely a natural trait. Some individuals are born with qualities like charisma and confidence that make them natural leaders. These qualities cannot be taught or developed; they are innate.
Sarah:
I respectfully disagree with Pedro on this one. Leadership is not solely dependent on innate qualities. It is a skill that can be cultivated through learning, experience, and practice. With the proper guidance and effort, anyone can develop leadership abilities, regardless of their initial traits or skills.
