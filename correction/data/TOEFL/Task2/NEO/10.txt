Question :Doctor Gupta:
This week, we will discuss the primary role of professors at the university. Professors are highly valued in society and connect students from the academy to the industry. But consider this question: Which do you think can be considered the most essential duty of a professor at a university? Building up a friendly atmosphere for learning or doing their best to teach students facts and ideas?
Joe:
Professors have various roles at university, among which I think bringing students closer to each other is more important because everything is learned and practiced more efficiently through teamwork and cooperation.
Saca:
A professor has to be perfect when it comes to teaching, I suppose. If professors are not good at teaching and transferring knowledge, students will be disappointed and might skip classes one by one. A friendly atmosphere is also essential, but it should not be the professor's primary task.
