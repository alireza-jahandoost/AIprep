Question :Doctor Ramirez:
Today, we will discuss a debated issue among entrepreneurs. When starting a business, choosing the right business partner is crucial for success. Some people believe that close friends can be excellent business partners too. On the other hand, others argue that mixing friendship and business can lead to complications and strain the relationship. What do you think about this?
Mike:
In my opinion, if two friends are very close and can trust each other, then the business can be great too. Such people will never cheat on each other in business. They know that their friend is always reliable and they can take big steps with each other such as big financial risks in business.
Stephanie:
In my opinion, friends can be great in business together only if they separate their friendship and business from each other. I mean, when they are at work, they should act like colleagues, and when they are free, act like intimate friends and have fun together. While in business, they should forget they are friends.
