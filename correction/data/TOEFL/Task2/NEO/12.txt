Question :Doctor Carlsen:
Today, let's discuss a subject of intense debate in developed countries - immigration. With globalization and increased mobility, immigration has become a complex and multifaceted topic. On one hand, some argue that strict immigration policies are necessary to protect national security and preserve cultural identity. On the other hand, some believe in supporting refugees and recognizing the economic and cultural contributions that immigrants bring. What are your thoughts on this ongoing discussion?
Ted:
I believe strict immigration policies are necessary to protect national security and preserve cultural identity. Without proper regulations, there is a risk of allowing individuals with dangerous intentions to enter the country. The safety of the citizens must be the priority of my government.
Claire:
I understand Ted's opinion, but I think that supporting refugees and recognizing their economic and cultural contributions is more important. Refugees often flee their home countries due to conflict or persecution and deserve compassion and assistance. We have a duty to help those in need.
