Question :Doctor Achebe:
Let's explore a topic related to the commodification of art. In recent years, the art market has seen a significant increase in the commercialization and commodification of artworks. Some experts argue that this trend has led to the prioritization of profit over artistic integrity. On the other hand, some experts argue that it brings more visibility and accessibility to artists, allowing them to reach a wider audience. What are your thoughts on the commodification of art and its impact on the art world?
Kelly:
I think the commodification of art has negatively impacted the art world, prioritizing profit over artistic integrity. Nowadays, we are surrounded by countless movies with the same theme, story, and minor changes in actors or scenes. I am afraid the true purpose of art is slowly being forgotten.
Clara:
I disagree with you, Kelly. The commodification of art can provide artists with visibility, financial support, and a wider audience while also attracting new collectors and investors to the art market. Art belongs to people, and artists should strive to create artworks that people enjoy most.
