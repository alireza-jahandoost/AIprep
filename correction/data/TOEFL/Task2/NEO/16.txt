Question :Doctor Costa:
Let's explore a topic related to human nature. The nature versus nurture debate has long been discussed. Some argue that human behavior is primarily influenced by genetics and inherent traits, suggesting that some characteristics are difficult to change. On the other hand, supporters of the nurture side argue that environmental factors, such as socialization and experiences, shape human behavior. What is your perspective on this topic?
Mike:
I believe that human behavior is primarily influenced by genetics and inherent traits. Certain characteristics can be challenging to change, suggesting that nature has a strong influence on human behavior. For example, some people cannot control their anger no matter how many therapists they visit.
Sally:
I disagree with you, Mike. While genetics may be important, it is the nurture side that plays a crucial role in shaping individuals. Our experiences significantly shape our behavior and attitudes. With the right environment and opportunities for growth, humans have the potential to adapt and change.
