Kelly:
Friends provide emotional support and a listening ear. Sharing thoughts and feelings with friends can alleviate loneliness. Whenever I face a challenge or dilemma, I talk with my close friends, and all of a sudden, I feel much more at peace.
Ross:
I understand Kellyâ€™s opinion. But to me, friends provide opportunities for social interaction and a sense of belonging to a community. We can expand our social circles, meet new people, and engage in new activities through friendships. Because of my friends, I know many people with whom I can have a conversation.
