Question :Doctor Smith:
Now, let's focus on a contentious debate surrounding the use of smartphones in educational settings. Some argue that prohibiting smartphones in schools can minimize distractions, enhance student focus, and promote better classroom engagement. On the other hand, opponents believe that children should be allowed to bring their phones to school, since smartphones can be valuable educational tools, providing access to information and facilitating collaboration. In your perspective, should schools ban students from bringing smartphones to school, or should they embrace smartphones as educational tools? Explain your reasoning.
Claire:
I strongly believe that schools should ban students from bringing smartphones to school. The presence of smartphones in the classroom is a constant source of distraction for students. This not only affects their own learning but also disrupts the learning environment for others.
Robert:
I disagree with Claire. Smartphones have become an integral part of our lives, and they offer a wide range of educational opportunities. With access to the internet, students can quickly search for information and collaborate with their peers on projects.
