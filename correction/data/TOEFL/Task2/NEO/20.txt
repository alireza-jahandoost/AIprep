Participating in extracurricular activities can positively impact a student's academic performance. Activities such as academic clubs or science competitions can enhance critical thinking because they often require research and presentation, which help students organize their thoughts.

I think extracurricular activities have the highest impact on developing a student's social skills. Joining sports teams or community service groups allows students to interact with peers with similar interests. This way, students learn how to build relationships and work towards common goals.
