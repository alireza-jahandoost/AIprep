Question :Doctor Diaz:
Let's now explore a dilemma that many individuals face when it comes to choosing their career path. Some individuals prioritize financial stability and select jobs that offer lucrative salaries, while others prioritize pursuing their passion, even if it means earning a lower income. In your opinion, is it better for individuals to prioritize a high salary over their passion when choosing a job, or should they prioritize following their passion even if it means earning less? Please explain your reasoning.
Nelson:
Financial stability is essential for a comfortable life, whereas choosing a job based on passion may lead to financial struggles and limitations. By prioritizing a high salary, individuals can always pursue their passions outside of work and achieve their goals.
Chloe:
I cannot entirely agree with Nelson. Money alone does not guarantee happiness or job satisfaction. Our careers occupy a significant part of our lives, and being passionate about our work can bring pleasure and fulfillment to our lives.
