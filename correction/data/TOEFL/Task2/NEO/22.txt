Question :Doctor Diaz:
This time, let's delve into a controversial topic concerning children to this day. Children have always been obsessed with choosing their future occupations. Some people believe that it is advantageous for children to choose jobs similar to their parents' professions, while others argue that opting for very different jobs can be more beneficial. In your view, which approach is more favorable and why?
Ted:
I believe children should choose jobs similar to their parents' professions. The road to success in a decent job is always tricky. However, by following in their parent's footsteps, children can benefit from their parents' experience and expertise, which can provide a solid basis for their own career paths.
Claire:
I have to disagree with Ted. Just because your parents were successful in a particular career, doesn't mean you will also be successful in it. Most of the time, children have different talents and passions from their parents. Therefore, choosing a separate career path allows children to explore their own interests and passions.
