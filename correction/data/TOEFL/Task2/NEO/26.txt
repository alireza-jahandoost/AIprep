Question :Doctor Achebe:
In our discussion on the importance of workplace mentoring, we learned that mentoring (training or guiding someone) is typically associated with senior employees―that is, workers who have been at a company for a long time and mentor younger colleagues. However, at some companies, especially those that use innovative technology, younger employees sometimes train or guide senior colleagues. Do you think that it is a good idea for companies to encourage younger employees to mentor senior coworkers? Why or why not?
Claire:
I support the idea of having younger employees mentor senior ones. Technology is developing so rapidly these days, and young people are much more skilled in dealing with technology than older employees are. It’s the ideal way for senior employees to learn new digital skills.
Kelly:
Claire makes a good point, but technology aside, I do not think that younger employees make good mentors right away. When younger employees join companies, they often lack the experience needed to be fully effective in their roles. They should be mentored by senior coworkers who have achieved a high level of expertise in their work.
