Question :Doctor Diaz:
This week we looked at how the cinema―the physical building where we watch films―has evolved over the years. Now, I want you to consider this question: with so many internet-streaming services available for viewing films at home, do you think cinemas will cease to exist in the future? Will a time come when people stop going to cinemas entirely? Why or why not?
Paul:
In my opinion, cinemas are here to stay. For thousands of years, people have been sharing the collective experience of watching a show, whether it was a live performance at a theater in ancient Greece or a recorded film in a cinema in today’s society. And they will continue to want that shared viewing experience.
Claire:
I agree that cinemas are becoming obsolete, but I don’t think it’s because of technology. Many of the best films these days are being produced as ten- or twelve-part miniseries, with much more focus on character development. These productions are meant to be watched on television. You don’t need a big screen to enjoy them.
