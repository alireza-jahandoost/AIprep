Question :Doctor Achebe:
This week, we will be discussing leadership; more specifically, we will be examining the various qualities found in all successful business leaders. To get you thinking about this topic, I’d like you to consider the following question: What is more important for being an effective leader of a business—excellent communication skills or a strong technical background in a particular industry?
Andrew:
The best leaders are the ones who are good communicators. If employees clearly understand what is expected of them—if their leader can articulate clearly and concisely what they need to do to achieve their goals—they will be more productive and efficient in their work.
Kelly:
It doesn’t matter how well a company’s leader communicates if they don’t have a deep understanding of the business itself. Employees aren’t going to be motivated by a company president who gives a great speech if it’s evident that the president doesn’t know what they do in their day-to-day work.
