Question :Professor:
Lately we’ve talked a lot about the impact of technology on our lives. With the prevalence of smartphones and other devices, we’re more connected than ever, but some people are distressed by this trend. We’ll discuss this in our next class, but before we do I’d like to hear your thoughts on the issue. Overall, do devices like smartphones have a positive impact on the way we communicate? Or a negative one?
Rachel:
Personally, I think this sort of technology has had a negative impact on our ability to communicate face-to-face. People are too reliant on text messages, social media, and things like that, which can lead to a lack of nuance and depth in our interactions. It’s harder to read body language and tone of voice over text, and that can result in misunderstandings and miscommunications. I think that if people want to become effective communicators, they should talk to people in person.
Mike:
While I agree that it can sometimes be challenging to communicate in person, I also think modern technology has its benefits. Smartphones make it possible for us to stay connected with acquaintances and loved ones who are far away, and social networks provide a platform for introverted people to express themselves in ways that they may not be able to do in person. Accordingly, I think smartphones are mostly beneficial.
