Question :Professor:
Today, we’re going to talk about the benefits and drawbacks of remote work. Many companies have implemented remote work policies in the past few years, and many others are considering joining them. Given that this represents a major change in the way we work and interact with each other, companies must carefully consider all relevant details before making a decision. What do you think? Is remote work beneficial, or do you think it’s a bad idea?
Sara:
I think remote work is a very positive trend. When we work from home, we spend commuting and we have more flexible schedules. Plus, many people find that they are more productive when working from home. Some people say this is because they aren’t distracted by their coworkers, while others suggest it’s because their energy isn’t drained during a long and bothersome commute.
Michael:
While I can see the benefits of remote work, I don’t think it should become the new normal. There’s something to be said for the atmosphere that comes from being in the same physical space as your colleagues. I also think that remote work can make it harder to build relationships and collaborate effectively. This means it might limit our chances to earn promotions and raises. And what about people who don’t have enough room for a home office? They’ll suffer if this trend continues.
