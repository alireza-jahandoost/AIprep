Question :Professor:
Next week, we’re going to spend a lot of time in class discussing the positive and negative ways in which companies affect the world around us. Before we start talking about that in class, I want to hear what you think about the topic. So here’s a question for the message board: In your opinion, what is the best way for a company to have a positive impact on society?
Sarah:
I believe that companies should focus on making their operations more socially and environmentally friendly. While charitable giving can be beneficial, it doesn’t address the root causes of serious social and environmental problems. By doing business in more responsible ways, companies can have a more meaningful and lasting impact on society. Moreover, if they attract positive attention from consumers they could inspire other companies to do the same. That’s the only way we can really solve today’s problems.
John:
While those are very good points, I think that companies should focus on charitable giving. Philanthropy can provide immediate relief to those in need and contribute to the overall well-being of society right away. It could take years or decades for business changes to have a positive impact on society, and most people just can’t wait that long.
