Question :Professor:
Life expectancies are increasing all over the world nowadays. Some of you probably know someone who is more than 100 years old. Before our next class, I want you to consider the following question: What factors do you think have contributed to the increase in life expectancy? Is it due to advances in medical technology, improvements in public health, changes in lifestyle habits, or something else entirely?
Lisa:
I think the main reason why people are living longer nowadays is recent advances in medical technology. Modern medicine has enabled us to better treat and manage chronic illnesses, and there have been major breakthroughs in areas such as cancer treatment and organ transplantation. As a result, people are able to live longer with diseases that may have been fatal in the past. Not only that, but they can live more rewarding and fulfilling lives.
John:
While medical technology has certainly played a role, I think improvements in government services have been just as important. We now have access to clean drinking water, sanitation systems, and free vaccines that have dramatically reduced health problems. In the past, people didnâ€™t have access to any of these things. Additionally, public health campaigns have helped educate people about healthy habits such as exercise, healthy eating, and about the danger of smoking.
