Question : Doctor Diaz:
Teachers often ask school administrators for permission to take their students on field trips (for example, to museums or historical buildings). Some school administrators provide funding and encouragement for teachers to organize educational trips for the entire class. Many believe that going on field trips is an important part of a child’s education; others think that a child’s time is better spent learning in a classroom at school. Which view do you agree with? Why?
Kelly:
Field trips are so demanding of a teacher’s time; I can understand why some people aren’t in favor of them. Teachers can’t just decide that it might be fun to take their class to an art museum. They must plan carefully to help children get the most out of that trip while not losing too much instructional time.
Paul:
Field trips can affect kids’ futures in important ways. One time I went on a field trip to a space museum when I was young. I even got to try on a space suit. That experience made me want to be an astronomer. I might not have developed my interest in astronomy without that field trip experience.
