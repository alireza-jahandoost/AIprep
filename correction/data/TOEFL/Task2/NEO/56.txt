Question : Doctor Gupta:
This week, I want you to discuss assessment criteria. Some schoolteachers give high grades (marks) only to those students who perform well on their homework assignments and tests. Other teachers, however, may give high grades to students who have worked very hard on their assignments but have not performed so well. Which approach do you think is better: Giving grades based only on performance, or grading students not just on performance but also on their effort?
Kelly:
I think grades should be based on performance only. It’s a matter of fairness. I’d be really upset if another student got nearly the same grade that I did when I turned in work that was almost perfect and the other student’s work had incorrect answers or unclear ideas. It wouldn’t matter to me if they worked harder.
Paul:
Sure, evaluation should mainly be based upon the student’s performance, but hard work should count for something. A student who works hard, even when the final grade isn’t the highest in the class, builds character, which will benefit the student later in life when they go to university or apply for a job.
