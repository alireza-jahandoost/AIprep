Question : Doctor Gupta:
Let’s discuss how teachers’ job performance is assessed or evaluated. Regular evaluations of teachers help to ensure that students receive high-quality instruction, that good teachers are rewarded, and that struggling teachers receive help to improve. But what is the best way to evaluate teachers? Should teachers be evaluated based on their students’ test scores? Should more-experienced teachers evaluate less-experienced teachers? Should students’ feedback be considered? Which approach is best, and why?
Andrew:
I think experienced senior teachers are the best source of information for teacher evaluations. School leaders can assign experienced teachers to observe their fellow teachers periodically during class, and these senior teachers can then provide feedback on their colleagues’ performance. An experienced teacher has the knowledge to determine what other teachers are doing well and what needs improvement.
Kelly:
I’m not convinced that any one person’s occasional visits to a classroom would provide accurate information. I’d like a more objective, fairer source of data, so I’d prefer to rely on test scores to inform teacher evaluations. If all students take the same test, and some classes perform better than others, then we know which teachers have been most successful.
