Question :Doctor Achebe:
In the next two weeks, we are going to be studying how biological discoveries have affected our lives. Research in biology provides us with a better understanding of how our bodies work. As an introduction to this topic, I would like you to discuss among yourselves the following question: What is the most important thing a person can do to maintain good health? Please explain why you think so.
Claire:
I feel very strongly that a good diet is the most important factor in maintaining good health. Eating good, healthy foods, especially green vegetables, gives your body the materials it needs to stay strong. Good nutrition is the key to good health.
Paul:
Most people don't visit the doctor for regular checkups. Sure, if they feel sick, they go, but that's not enough. During a yearly exam, a physician can help a patient address health issues before they become a larger problem. So, I think preventive doctor visits are key to good health.
