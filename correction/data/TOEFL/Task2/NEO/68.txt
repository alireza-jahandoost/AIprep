Question :Doctor Achebe:
Local governments have limited budgets to spend on enriching residents' lives. Supporting arts programs like concerts and museums offers cultural engagement, while funding recreational activities like hiking trails and parks promotes healthy lifestyles. As students who appreciate culture and wellness, let's discuss whether local funding should support arts programs or recreational activities more. Which do you think better serves the community and why?
Kelly:
I think local governments should prioritize spending on outdoor trails and parks rather than arts programs like museums and concerts. More people would use and benefit from improved recreation spaces than arts venues. If fewer residents are interested in the arts, they won't attend museums or concerts even if government funds them.
Andrew:
I believe local governments should actually prioritize spending on arts programs like museums and concerts rather than recreation. Precisely because fewer residents are inherently interested in the arts, public funding is essential to sustain these cultural institutions for the minority who appreciate them. Without support, access to the arts will decline and society will lose these enriching, enduring outlets for creative expression.
