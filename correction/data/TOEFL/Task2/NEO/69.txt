Question :Doctor Achebe:
Let's consider how schools allocate their funds for various resources, with a focus on the allocation between teacher salaries and other resources such as computers and books. What do you think is the best way for schools to prioritize their spending? Should more funds go towards increasing teacher salaries to attract and retain quality educators, or should they invest more in technology and learning materials like computers and books?
Claire:
I think raising teachers' salaries is crucial because it can encourage people to view teaching as a viable profession rather than pursuing careers in other industries. Additionally, offering competitive wages can attract some of the brightest and most talented individuals to become teachers. When teachers are fairly compensated, it not only motivates them to excel in their roles but also enhances the overall quality of education.
Paul:
Teacher salaries are already quite competitive, and it may be more prudent to allocate resources toward improving student equipment and providing up-to-date materials. Enhancing the learning environment with better technology and modern educational resources can greatly benefit students' education.
