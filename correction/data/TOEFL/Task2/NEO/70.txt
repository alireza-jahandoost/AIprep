Question :Dr.Diaz:
This week, we will be discussing retail sales. One popular model of retail is "superstores"-very large stores, typically owned by corporations- that sell many kinds of different products. We will compare this business model to local retailers, typically small or specialized stores with local owners, such as a camera shop or a small neighborhood grocery store. Do you think it is more beneficial for people to shop at small local stores rather than at superstores? Why or why not?
Kelly:
Shopping at small local stores benefits consumers in many ways. One of the benefits is that small stores often offer better services than large stores. For example, if you need your bicycle repaired, usually the small shop can do it right there in the shop. At the large stores, they have to send it to the manufacturer to be repaired.
Andrew:
Although I understand the importance of shopping at small stores to support the local community, there are obvious benefits to shopping at superstores. Because large retailers procure products in bulk, they can offer their customers a wide variety of products, usually at low prices. So, by shopping at large stores, consumers get better value for their money.
