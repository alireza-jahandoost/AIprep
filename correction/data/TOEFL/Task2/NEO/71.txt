Question :Dr.Diaz:
In today's rapidly evolving job market, skills and knowledge constantly need updating. For adults who are about to start working, lifelong learning is very important and there are many adult courses available today, covering a wide range of subjects. These courses provide an opportunity for continuous learning. In your opinion, which subjects should adults focus on most? What are the areas of knowledge or skills that are most beneficial for adults to learn and why?
Andrew:
I believe learning foreign languages is really important for adults. In modern society, being able to speak different languages is more important than ever. People should aim to learn about 4 to 5 foreign languages if they can. It not only opens doors to different cultures but also gives us an advantage in the professional world.
Claire:
I would say that the arts have a huge role to play in adult learning. They encourage us to think outside the box, to be creative and innovative-skills that are really valued in the modern job market. Plus, engaging in the arts can make us feel happier, help us relax, and let us see things in new ways. It's good for our minds and can make us better at our jobs.
