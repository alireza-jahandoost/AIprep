Question :Dr. Achebe:
This week, we've been discussing ways to protect the environment. One way is to require companies to pay penalties, such as higher taxes or large fines, when they pollute and damage the environment. We're going to explore this topic in depth tomorrow, but first I'd like to get your thoughts: Do you think imposing these taxes and fines would be a good way to stop companies from harming the environment? Why or why not?
Andrew:
I don't think it will be effective. Where I live, the local government imposes fines on polluting companies, but it doesn't stop them. I know of one business that created a lot of water pollution. Instead of changing their ways, they just paid a fine. No one was really punished, and the pollution is still a problem.
Claire:
I think it's an excellent idea. As long as there is no penalty for polluting the environment, these companies will not bother searching for alternatives to practices that contribute to air, water, or land pollution. And it should be a financial penalty because every company worries about money.
