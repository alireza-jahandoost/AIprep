Question :Dr. Achebe:
Today, I'd like to discuss choices people make in terms of where they decide to live. Some people choose to spend their entire lives in one town or city. Others leave their hometowns and might even move several times from one town or city to another. I'd like to get your thoughts on this subject. Do you think it is better to live in one town or city all your life? Why or why not?
Andrew:
Living in one place your whole life is the better option. It allows you to form strong bonds with neighbors and members of your community. You know that if you stay in one place for a long time, you will always have friends you can rely on when you need help.
Claire:
Moving from one city to another has some advantages. Adapting to different situations is an important skill to have in life, and moving forces a person to develop this skill. Having to make new friends and start over in a new city is a challenging exercise that builds character.
