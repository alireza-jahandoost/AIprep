Question :Doctor Gupta:
This week, our focus in class is the creation and evolution of public school policies. A crucial aspect of educational policy pertains to the selection of courses offered in schools. With the emergence of new communication methods and evolving employment opportunities, there is a growing belief that schools should introduce innovative subjects. The question I would like to explore is whether these new and unique subjects should be included in the curriculum of public schools.
Paul:
I firmly believe that public schools should introduce new courses. For example, people are increasingly communicating through sharing photos and videos on the internet. I think a course on video composition - how to create compelling and effective videos - would be highly valuable for today's students. There are many other similar topics that students could benefit from as well.
Kelly:
I don't believe that high school curriculums need to change drastically. The primary aim of most high school courses is to prepare students for higher education, and those fundamental requirements haven't changed. If students want to learn something like composition or film editing, they can watch instructional videos on the internet. They don't need to take classes in school to learn these things.
