Question :Dr. Gupta:
More and more, online shopping is becoming the primary way that many people obtain everyday goods. But what are the ramifications for the society in which we live? On the one hand, online shopping has advantages; for example, I can make a purchase without ever leaving my home. However, with fewer people shopping at local shops, in some places, these establishments are having a hard time competing. Do you think that online shopping is, on the whole, affecting society negatively or positively?
Andrew:
I think that online shopping has had negative impacts on society. In my city, many local stores have shelves filled with various products that you can find in online stores. This has forced some of them to close down, which not only affects the amount of tax revenue generated in our local community, but also impacts the number of job opportunities available to the community members.
Kelly:
It's unfortunate that some local stores are forced to close down, but that's the nature of competition. As consumers, we benefit greatly from online shopping due to lower prices. Even if I find a physical store that can compete with online sellers in terms of pricing, I am still likely to make the purchase online, because it means I don't have to spend money on transportation to the store.
