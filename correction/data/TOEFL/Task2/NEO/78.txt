Question :Dr. Diaz:
Secondary or high school students (ages 14-18) who plan to attend university must begin thinking about what field of study they'll enter. Some students might be directed into certain fields by their parents and teachers. Others prefer to make their own choice based on their own interests and feelings. Do you believe that secondary school students should be allowed to choose their own field of study at university without being guided by parents and teachers? Why?
Claire:
I think it's a mistake to let students at that age make such an important decision on their own. They usually don't have the wisdom to choose appropriately. The people who know them best-their parents and teachers-will be more objective and give the best guidance.
Paul:
Choosing a field of study, and perhaps a career in that field, based mainly on what others tell you to do seems wrong to me. My parents wanted me to study engineering, but I'm not interested in that; I want to help people learn. I know I'll struggle more financially as a teacher, but I'm sure I'll be happier.
