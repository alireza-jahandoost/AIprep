Question :Dr. Diaz:
When people are choosing a career, there are many different factors to consider. What aspects of a job do people value most? Salary is a possible factor. These days, with work environments evolving, human interaction might be an important factor. If you had to choose, is it better to have a job with a high salary but little or no human interaction, or a job with a lower salary that allows for regular interaction with colleagues or customers? Why?
Paul:
In order for people to be truly satisfied with a job, they need validation. This can only come from frequent and productive interaction with coworkers who acknowledge their hard work and contributions. I think everyone is looking for a job where they will receive positive feedback from their colleagues and recognition for their achievements.
Claire:
I think that salary is the number one factor in determining whether a certain job is good or not. In any job interview, the first question many of us, including myself, really want answered is how much the job pays. Being a practical person, l would say the purpose of work is to earn money, not to socialize with others.
