Question :Dr. Diaz:
Today, we will examine what economists call incentives-the motivations that lead people to make certain choices. Cost is a major category of economic incentives. People tend to change their behavior when a particular choice gets more expensive. Let's discuss an example. Some economists argue that a good way to reduce air pollution is for governments to raise the cost (through taxes or other means) of fuel for cars. Do you agree or disagree with this viewpoint?
Ted:
I think it would be a good idea to raise fuel prices. Making it more expensive to drive cars would cause many people to choose public transportation or use bicycles instead. In my city, they've just added bicycle lanes to all of the major roads. So, it would be easy to give up driving.
Claire:
I disagree. Why should individuals be punished with such an added expense in their daily lives? The argument for a consumer fuel tax makes the assumption that cars are the biggest source of air pollution, and we need to question if that's an accurate assumption.
