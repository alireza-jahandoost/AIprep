Question :Dr. Rodriguez:
In this course, we've been studying current events and discussing the value of being educated consumers of news. However, there is also an opinion that we should periodically limit our exposure to current events and even take breaks from the news. Do you think it is beneficial to take breaks from reading or watching the news for a period of a few days or weeks? Why or why not?
Josh:
Beneficial or not, it would be impossible. Today, we're exposed to the news everywhereâ€“on our phones, on our computers, on big TV screens, in waiting rooms, and in airport lounges. To take a break from the news, you would have to withdraw from all activities in society, which is unrealistic.
Clara:
I think that taking a break from the news could be helpful psychologically. It obviously depends on how long a break we take. Completely avoiding watching or reading the news may be too extreme, but taking a short break from the news could help us avoid news stories that may affect us negatively.
