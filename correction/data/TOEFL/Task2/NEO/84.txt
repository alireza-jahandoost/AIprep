Question :Dr. Diaz:
In the next few weeks, we'll be discussing different learning options and their respective benefits and drawbacks. Let's focus now on online classes, which are becoming more and more popular. In online classes, students communicate with their professors and other students completely online. Do you think that online classes offer advantages to both students and teachers that make them preferable to traditional in-person classes? Why or why not?
Emily:
I believe online classes are preferable to traditional face-to-face classes, both for students and teachers. Because online classes allow more flexibility (for example, in terms of location and time), they better accommodate students and teachers with busy schedules. The quality of online classes has considerably improved, so online classes now present excellent learning options.
Mathew:
Online classes don't have any advantages over traditional in-person classes. What's important is how good the teacher is. An online class won't be any good if the instructor isn't a talented teacher. But an online class can be effective if the teacher knows how to teach and how to use online resources. Teacher competence is what matters most.
