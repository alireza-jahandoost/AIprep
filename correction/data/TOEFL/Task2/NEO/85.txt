Question :Dr. Achebe:
This week, we are going to discuss charitable work and community service: ordinary people volunteering their time to help their communities. Charitable or community-support activities range from cleaning up neighborhoods to running youth clubs or caring for older people. But many communities experience a problem: there are not enough people willing to do charitable or community work. What is one good way to encourage more people to do charitable or community work? Explain your choice.
Claire:
Others might disagree, but I think one way to get more people to do charitable work is to pay them for their time. Even a small amount that a charitable organization coordinating the work could afford would help. I think younger people in particular would be more willing to participate if they could earn a little money.
Joe:
I'm not sure I agree with Claire. People should participate because it is the right thing to do, not because there is a financial reward. Maybe the solution is in making people understand how important community work is. If people have a better understanding of that, they will be more willing to do their part.
