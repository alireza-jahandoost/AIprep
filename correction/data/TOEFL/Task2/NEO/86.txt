Question :Dr. Diaz:
Automation is a much-discussed topic in economics, one that continues to grow in importance with today's advances in robotics and artificial intelligence, or Al. Robots and Al provide powerful ways to replace human labor by doing work better and faster than people can. Automation can have very positive effects on businesses and the broader economy, but there are disadvantages as well. What do you think? Is the use of automation a positive development?
Claire:
I think the use of automation is a positive development. If Al and robots are used instead of human workers, companies will be able to produce many more products than they do now. They can also lower costs, making those products cheaper for people to buy. As a result, everyone will have access to more affordable products.
Joe:
I worry about the psychological effects on people as Al and robots take over work. I doubt humans will really be happy with ever-greater amounts of leisure time. Many of us derive satisfaction from working and doing our jobs well. In fact, never in human history have we been able to spend large parts of our days labor-free.
