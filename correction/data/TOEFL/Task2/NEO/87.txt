Question :Dr. Achebe:
Ensuring that high school students get the education they need is challenging. Some educators are recognizing that regular classes at school may not be enough to prepare students for careers and for life. Because of this, they recommend that all high school students be required to spend a specific number of hours learning useful skills outside school. Others think that this requirement is not appropriate for all students. Which view do you agree with? Why?
Emily:
I believe that it is important to learn some skills outside school, but I disagree that this should be a requirement. Many high school students are already overburdened with core subjects like mathematics or history. Since those students are already struggling to find time to study, learning other things outside school can wait until after they graduate from high school.
Kate:
I think that learning outside the classroom is a necessity, and I agree that it should be required. Many students lack basic life skills -such as budgeting, first aid, or cooking- and this has many negative consequences. Students could learn basic life skills outside school under the guidance of parents or experts in various fields.
