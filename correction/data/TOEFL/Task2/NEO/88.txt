Question :Dr. Diaz:
This week, we will discuss issues faced by secondary school administrators. I'm referring to schools for teenage students. One such issue is students who change schools. Students change schools for many different reasons, the most common being a family move. On the discussion board, I want you to exchange ideas about what schools can do to make the transition to a new school easier for teenagers.
Claire:
I think schools should assign new students a fellow student who can help them adjust. The "student buddy" can do things like make sure the new student can find the cafeteria or the right classrooms. For new students, it's a lot easier to ask a fellow student a question rather than ask a teacher or the principal.
Emily:
I would require new students to sign up for some school club or activity that meets outside of class. That way, new students would have an easy way to meet other students in a friendly environment. It would give them a group to immediately identify with.
