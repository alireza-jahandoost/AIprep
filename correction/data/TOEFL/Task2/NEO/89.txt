Question :Dr. Gonzalez:
Charitable giving-that is, the voluntary donation of money to charities-is important in many societies. Some people prefer to give to charities that provide help all over the world, while others prefer to give to local charities that focus on solving problems in the giver's own community. For individuals who want to give to only one of those types of charities, international or local, which is the better choice? Why?
Claire:
By donating to a local charity, such as a shelter that helps homeless animals, you can visit the shelter and see for yourself how donations are being used to confirm that your money is being well spent. You may even be encouraged to give more because you were able to witness the positive effects your contribution had on the organization.
George:
It is more effective to donate money to international charities that work on issues that affect us all, such as the effects of climate change. Some charities that operate on a large scale have influenced national governments to adjust their air and water pollution policies, which is a great way to make a big impact.
