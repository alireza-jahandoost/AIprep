Question :Dr. Achebe:
In the past, it was common for people to stay at one job for a long time, possibly for their whole career. This has changed in recent years, though, and nowadays many people tend to change jobs quite often. Proponents of this job market trend point to many benefits of regularly changing careers. Today, I would like to know what you think. Do you agree that the benefits of switching jobs often outweigh the disadvantages? Why or why not?
Paul:
I believe that it can be beneficial for people to change jobs often. If you do the same job for a long time (for example, several years), you might become too comfortable with the job. This could mean the job is no longer challenging for you and it could cause you to be bored and unsatisfied at work.
Emily:
I agree with some of what Paul wrote, but we also need to consider the disadvantages of changing jobs often. Switching jobs can make you feel insecure and exhausted, especially if you are changing fields and have to learn new skills. Additionally, you have to adapt to a new environment and new colleagues, which can be overwhelming as well.
