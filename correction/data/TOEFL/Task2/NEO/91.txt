Question :Dr. Diaz:
We've been discussing business strategies and the attitudes of business people toward risk and opportunity. The scientist Albert Einstein once said that a person who never made a mistake never tried anything new. He was probably referring to physics, but I wonder how this attitude might apply to the business world. Do you think it is a good business strategy to take continual risks even though they might result in mistakes that could affect a company negatively?
Paul:
I think this strategy can easily backfire on a businessperson. I've seen companies conduct endless cycles of product enhancements in an effort to capture some other market share. But in reality, they just damage their own brand by sacrificing too much of the original content that made the product popular in the first place.
Claire:
I disagree with Paul. Most profitable businesses have used this strategy, or they would have never made it to the top. If you try to grow a business aggressively, some mistakes along the way are inevitable. Too much caution or too much emphasis on avoiding mistakes can really prevent growth.
