Question :Dr. Achebe:
Last class, we started talking about how almost anyone today can write and post news articles to a Web site or even host a news podcast. People no longer need a degree in journalism or a professional connection to a news outlet to express their views and ideas to a wide audience. Some people believe this development negatively affects the field of journalism as well as consumers of news. Do you agree with this viewpoint? Why or why not?
Sarah:
I do worry that people practicing journalism without professional training can actually harm others. Journalism courses in universities really emphasize the importance of checking facts and doing thorough research. I am concerned that someone who has not been taught journalistic standards may mislead readers in potentially harmful ways.
Ted:
In the past, there was a much more limited range of views expressed in newspapers and other publications. I think we benefit today because many different points of view are expressed on social media. While journalistic standards on the Internet may not always be high, at least readers get to hear stories that might not otherwise be told.
