Question :Dr. Achebe:
This week, we are talking about how different cities choose to either preserve or replace older, historic buildings. Some cities have strict rules about preserving older buildings and homes, especially those with historic architecture. Others tend to encourage new construction to replace structures that are aging and decaying. Should cities try to save historic buildings or replace them with more modern ones?
Ted:
I think the preservation of old historic buildings involves a lot of problems, especially in densely populated cities. In modern cities, land is very valuable, and old buildings just do not provide as much living and working space as modern high-rise buildings. Also, they were not built to modern standards, so they may waste energy through inefficient heating and cooling.
Claire:
It's important to preserve historic buildings. Keeping original architecture helps preserve a city's culture. Even on the practical side, most big cities get an economic benefit from tourism, and historic buildings like hotels and theaters are big attractions. Who wants to visit a city where all the buildings are glass and steel and look like buildings in every other city?
