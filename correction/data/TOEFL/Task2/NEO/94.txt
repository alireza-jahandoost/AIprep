Question :Dr. Diaz:
Let's discuss the role that being on a sports team plays in a child's development. Many argue that playing a team sport, such as basketball, football, or baseball, is an important experience that all children can benefit from in different ways. Conversely, others feel that the focus on team sports for children does more harm than good. What do you think? Is participation in team sports important for a child's development? Why or why not?
Sarah:
Of course, children should participate in team sports! Not everyone is a great student. For many children, team sports are a chance to excel and build their confidence. They can recognize the importance of working hard to accomplish a goal, and this can transfer to other aspects of their lives.
Claire:
I don't think participating in team sports is always a good thing. One reason is the bad behavior of parents during their children's competitions. Too many parents get overly invested and want to win more than their children do. To that end, they will argue with sports officials and referees and set a bad example for their children.
