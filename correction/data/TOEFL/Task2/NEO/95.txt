Question :Dr. Diaz:
In recent years, there has been a significant integration of advanced machines and artificial intelligence (Al) into our daily lives and work environments. l would like you to reflect on the following question: Should we extend the same level of politeness and respect to Al and machines as we do to humans? Please provide your reasoning and discuss the potential consequences of adopting such an approach.
Adam:
Al and robots play an integral role in our lives, assisting us in various tasks and making our lives easier. By treating them with respect, we not only acknowledge their contributions but also reflect positively on our own character. lt's a small gesture that upholds our humanity and sets a standard for ethical interaction with technology.
Claire:
I think we don't need to treat Al and robots with the same politeness as we do humans. They are tools designed to assist us, and it's important to maintain that distinction. We should set clear guidelines and boundaries for their use to ensure they serve us effectively without overstepping their roles.
