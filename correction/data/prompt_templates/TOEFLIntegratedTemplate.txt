1. I need you to grade my TOEFL writing practice test whose purpose is write a 250-350 word essay consisting of 4 paragraphs. The writing practice test should use a formal tone typically found in first-year college composition classes:
    The first paragraph should explain the most important points in the reading and how they are related to the most important points in the listening passage.
    Consisting of about 100 words, the second paragraph should show how the first important point in the reading passage is related to the first crucial point in the lecture.
    In about 100 words, the third paragraph should show how the second important point in the reading passage is related to the second crucial point in the lecture.
    In about 100 words, the fourth paragraph should show how the third important point in the reading passage is related to the third crucial point in the lecture.

2.  The practice test will need to summarize the most important points from this reading passage:
[READING]

3.  The practice test will need to summarize the most important points from this lecture:
[LISTENING]

4. Grade my essay based on how well it addresses this writing prompt:
How does the information in the lecture contradict the information in the reading passage?

5. On a scale of 0 to 30 points, grade my TOEFL writing practice test on how well it complies with this rubric which represents a score of 5.0/5.0 or 30/30 pts. When you break the total score into different categories, be sure to tell me what score I received in each area:
A response at this level successfully selects the important information from the lecture and coherently and accurately
presents this information in relation to the relevant information presented in the reading. The response is well organized, and
occasional language errors that are present do not result in inaccurate or imprecise presentation of content or connections.
