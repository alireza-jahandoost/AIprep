### TOEFL Writing Task 1: Essay Evaluation Prompt

#### **Task:**  
Please evaluate my TOEFL writing practice essay (250-350 words, 4 paragraphs) written in a formal academic tone similar to a first-year college composition class.

#### **Essay Structure:**  
Your evaluation will focus on the following four-paragraph structure:

1. **Paragraph 1:**  
   Summarize the most important points from both the reading and lecture, highlighting how they relate (approximately 100 words).
   
2. **Paragraph 2:**  
   Compare and contrast the first major point in the reading with the first key point in the lecture, focusing on contradictions (approximately 100 words).
   
3. **Paragraph 3:**  
   Compare and contrast the second major point in the reading with the second key point in the lecture, focusing on contradictions (approximately 100 words).
   
4. **Paragraph 4:**  
   Compare and contrast the third major point in the reading with the third key point in the lecture, focusing on contradictions (approximately 100 words).

#### **Grading Criteria:**  
Evaluate my essay based on the extent to which it addresses this prompt:  
**"How does the information in the lecture contradict the information in the reading?"**

#### **Evaluation Rubric:**  
Rate the essay on a scale of 0 to 30, with 5.0/5.0 representing 30/30 points. Please grade the essay across the following areas:

1. **Content (5 points):**  
   Does the response accurately and coherently summarize the key points from the reading and lecture, and effectively demonstrate contradictions?
   
2. **Organization (5 points):**  
   Is the essay well-structured, with clear topic sentences and smooth transitions between ideas?

3. **Language (5 points):**  
   Does the essay employ a variety of sentence structures and vocabulary? Are grammar and mechanics mostly error-free, with only minor errors that don't hinder comprehension?

4. **Tense Usage:**  
   The essay should primarily use the **simple present tense** for discussing opinions and current issues, and the **simple past tense** for discussing past events. Ensure tense consistency.

5. **Paraphrasing:**  
   Information from the reading should be paraphrased, while lecture content can be directly referenced.

6. **Transitions:**  
   At least two transitional words or phrases should be used per paragraph to enhance cohesion.

7. **Content Balance:**  
   Roughly two-thirds of each paragraph should focus on the listening content and one-third on the reading content.

8. **Spelling & Formatting:**  
   Ensure that formatting and spelling errors are minimal (less than 8).

9. **No Extraneous Information:**  
   The response should not introduce any information beyond what is present in the reading passage and lecture transcript.

#### **LLM-Specific Guidelines:**  
To ensure that responses from LLMs are effective:

- **Avoid overly brief responses:** Responses should fully engage with each part of the rubric, providing a balanced and insightful analysis.
  
- **Avoid overly lengthy responses:** Stay concise and focused, adhering to the 500-600 word range. Do not include redundant explanations or excessive details unrelated to the core analysis.
