I find Sam's perspective on the benefits of physical activities more intriguing than Mandy's. Though meditation may be beneficial to personal well-being, it does not have the same level of impact on everyone's mental health. In other words, yoga and meditation offer subjective benefits utterly dependent on individual circumstances. However, as Sam advocates, physical exercise has been consistently shown to have numerous positive effects on mental and physical health due to the release of endorphins. Endorphins have many benefits. Studies have shown they can help in decreasing stress and anxiety and improving self-image. Moreover, Participating in physical activities with others allows individuals to develop teamwork and communication skills. Working together towards a common goal or engaging in friendly competition can strengthen relationships and create lasting bonds. This social aspect of physical activities can provide emotional support, motivation, and a sense of accountability, ultimately enhancing overall well-being and happiness.
