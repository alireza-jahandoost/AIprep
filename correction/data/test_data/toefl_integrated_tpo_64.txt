The article introduces the topic of broccoli, a plan grown merely in temperate climates with ample nutrients and vitamins. After stating that by changing broccoli genetically, it can be cultivated in other climates, the writer points out three benefitial reasons about this project. Nevertheless, the lecturer denies them all, arguing that the project will neither be successful nor beneficial, and addresses, in detail, the trouble with each point made in the reading text.
First and foremost, the author claims that by cultivating broccoli near each city, the transporation cost will decrease, which lowers the price of it. The professor, on the other hand, contradicts the idea, demonstrating that the new broccoli would be resistant to the climate, but the amount of products produced will decrease. As a result, in total, since the amount of cultivated broccoli in a limited amount of ground is overweighs the transportation costs, the broccoli produced in California would be less pricey than the genetically changed ones.
Afterwards, the writer avers that because of the fact that new broccoli is not in the harmful category of genetically modified plants, people will trust them. In contrast, the lecturer believes there are flaws in the article's argument. She holds that the new broccoli generated by the same companies that people distrust. For this reason, the new product of these companies will probably get rejected by people as well.
Finally, the third reason presented in the listening refutes the belief in the passage that hence the vegetables are healthiest after harvesting, preparing broccoli nearer to customers will preserve the nutrients and vitamins more than being cultivated and transported about 4000 kilometers. The speaker highlights that instead of changing this vegetable genetically so it could get cultivated near other cities, people of each city could get educated to eat fresh vegetables able to be harvested on their local lands. In this way, no genetic modification will be needed and the problem will be solved too.
