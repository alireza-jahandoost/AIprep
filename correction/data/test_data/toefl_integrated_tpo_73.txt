The article introduces the topic of yellow crazy ant, a species of ants spreading to many areas of ‎Earth and bringing about ample damage to native ecosystems. After stating that these ants are ‎crucial threat for palm forest ecosystem in the Seychelles Islands, the writer points out three ‎solutions for the explicated problem. Nevertheless, the lecturer denies them all, arguing that, ‎unfortunately, the suggestions are unlikely to work, and addresses, in detail, the trouble with each ‎point made in the reading text.‎
First and foremost, the author claims that by using some traps containing harmful chemical for the ‎ants, which used in an island near Australia and were successful, the population of the crazy ants ‎will reduce dramatically. Conversely, the professor contradicts the idea, demonstrating that the ‎reason why this method was successful in Australia is that site does not have any native species of ‎ants. He goes on to say that the traps will unintendedly affect native ants living in the palm forest, ‎causing more damage to the ecosystem.‎
Afterward, the writer avers that another solution is to cut down broad-leaved trees, the crazy ant's ‎favorite habitats. Consequently, because of lack of habitat, their population will decreased ‎significantly. In contrast, the lecturer believes there are flaws in the article's argument. He holds ‎that the fact is crazy yellow ants thrive in several kinds of sites, one of which is mentioned trees. ‎But another habitat for them is open areas exposed to sun light, and by cutting down broad-leaved ‎trees, this type of habitat will get extended in which ants will live.‎
Finally, the third reason presented in the listening refutes the belief in the passage that the ‎populations of the yellow ants are denser in the fields near to human activities; therefore, by ‎reducing the human activity in palm forests, their population will decrease as well. The speaker ‎highlights that although this solution might slow down the problem, it will lead to economic ‎problems for that area. More specifically, because of unique ecosystem there, many tourists and ‎scientists are attracted each year, which is an important source of income for natives there, and by ‎limiting it, many economic problems will happen in the area.‎
